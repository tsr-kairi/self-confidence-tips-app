      "You may think that people who are self-confident are never fearful. This simply is not true. Fear means you are at your growing edge. [12] Perhaps your fear is speaking in front of a group, introducing yourself to someone you don't know, or asking your boss for a raise.",

If possible, see what lessons are there. Not meeting your goal the first time around is an opportunity to learn more about yourself. Self-confidence needs to be nurtured and grown, a bit at a time.`,

If you want to build up your confidence, then you need to know that there will always be someone who is prettier, smarter, and richer than you, just like there will always be someone who is less attractive, less intelligent, and less wealthy than you are; all of this is irrelevant, and what is relevant is caring about advancing your own goals and dreams.`,
